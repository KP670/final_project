            <h2>Who we are?</h2>
            <p>
                We are a family-owned and operated cafe located in the beautiful island of Saipan. 
                We offer a variety of delicious dishes, from breakfast to dinner, as well as coffee, tea, smoothies, and desserts.

            </p>
            <p>Our cafe was established in 2020 by John and Jane Smith, who moved to Saipan from California. 
               They wanted to share their passion for food and coffee with the local community and the tourists who visit the island. They also wanted to create a place where people can feel at home and enjoy the tropical atmosphere of Saipan. Cozy Palm Cafe is named after the palm trees that surround the cafe and provide shade and beauty.</p>
            <p>We are proud to use fresh and local ingredients in our dishes, as well as organic and fair-trade coffee beans. We also support local farmers and artisans by featuring their products in our menu and our gift shop. We believe in giving back to the community and the environment, and we participate in various charitable and sustainability initiatives.</p>
            <p>We invite you to come and visit us at Cozy Palm Cafe, where you can experience the best of Saipan’s cuisine and culture. We are open from 0800 to 2100, Monday to Saturday, and from 1100 to 1900 on Sunday. You can also follow us on Facebook and Instagram to see our latest updates and promotions.
